rubygems_bldr
=============

This rubygems_bldr is similar in intent to the perlmod_bldr which is 
to bridge the gap between a language specific packaging system like "gems"
or "cpan" and general purpose packaging systems like debian, gentoo, 
RPM, conary, and the like.  The intent is to create a bundle of ruby gems
and release that collection every so often to developers and application
servers with little knowledge of the language specific package manager.

This is a standard autoconf package that runs the gems utility when you
type "make dist" to harvest the internet for a list of gems.  The 
resulting tarball output from "make dist" contains in it all the gem
tarballs so that you can build/stage install/package these gems for
downstream release targets like Solaris, Mac, Cygwin, Linux without
a connection to the network.  To release you follow the standard autotools
approach

    tar xzf <release tarball>
    cd <release dir>
    ./configure
    make
    make DESTDIR=/my/pkg/dir install

All general purpose package managers have tools to automate autotools 
package creation.

The Perl Module Builder package uses the improved CPANPLUS mechanism of CPAN
to harvest the CPAN modules needed and store them in a local CPAN repo.
This local repo and some scripts are tar'd with the autoconf "make dist" 
mechanism.  This defines a versioned release of a group of CPAN perl modules.

The release is now a package just like any other autotools package that can be
unpacked, configured with "./configure" and installed.

Ruby gems packages are easy to package compared to CPAN.  Thanks gems!


This package is currently very early...
It doesn't yet deal with firewall proxies.
It doesn't yet deal with itself being installed!!!
   This may get tricky to fix...
Doesn't yet modularize gems into package groups
Is a first attempt from a non-ruby coder (Lee Thompson)

That said, it is a way keep current with gems updates with formal releases.
If new gems releases are problematic, you can go back and patch old gems
since the source release can be patched.

This package supports staged installs, important for package building.

With a staged install, you can develop the next version of the pacakge
without root access which is superior because more people can participate
in the development.
