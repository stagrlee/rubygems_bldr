Lee Thompson wrote this during the LoneStar Ruby Conference in Austin, TX
on Sept 6, 2008.  Based on perlmod_bldr.

Note - the release source tarball package contains a bundle of numerous
ruby gem modules written and maintained by numerous ruby gems developers
hosted on http://gems.rubyforge.org/ and http://gems.github.com.  The
source release of all these upstream works is contained in their entirety.  
The actual source in this package repository is very tiny, and hosted on
github, and is an original work.
