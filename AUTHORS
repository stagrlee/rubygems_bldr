Lee Thompson wrote this during the LoneStar Ruby Conference in Austin, TX
on Sept 6, 2008.  Based on perlmod_bldr.

Note - the release source tarball package contains a bundle of numerous
ruby gem modules written and maintained by numerous ruby gems developers
and hosted on CPAN.org.  The source release of all these upstream works
is contained in their entirety.  The source repository is very tiny, 
hosted on github, and is an original work.
